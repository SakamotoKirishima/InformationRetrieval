Whoa, here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey, I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much

And I can't recall
Any love at all
Ah baby, this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
...
