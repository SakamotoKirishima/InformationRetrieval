I get up
And nothin' gets me down
You got it tough
I've seen the toughest around
And I know baby just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real

Ah, can't you see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah
Might as well jump (jump)
Might as well jump
...
