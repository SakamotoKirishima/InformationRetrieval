I got a one track mind
My blinders up
Now all I gotta do is get up, go out, and get her
Got the first step down
Uh-know what I want
All seven senses tryin' to deliver

Now baby, let me fill you up inside (Up inside)
Spread your wings and (Open wide) open wide
So hot! So hot! So hot!

I'm a man on a mission
Straight ahead, less talk, more action
With no distractions
I'm all conditioned, thoroughbred
Go for the action, with no distractions yeah

You give every inch
Flesh, blood and bone
...
