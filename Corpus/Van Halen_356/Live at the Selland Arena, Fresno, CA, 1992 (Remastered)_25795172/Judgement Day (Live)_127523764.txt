Arr-heah!

It's my life. Get off my ass, get outta my face
Man, I don't see no problem
Kickin' back, ain't kickin' you, no no!
Anyway, if I make 'em, I'll solve 'em

Whoa, oh, ohh. That's right. Yeah yeah-yeah. Woo!

Makin' plan's a waste. Ain't no future here
Got no faith, got no religion

Oh tell me why (ooh-ooh) should I (ooh-ooh)
(Ahh) Care or even, why should I try?
I just slide slide on by (ooh-ooh)
(Ahh) Never bad enough to crucify me

Huah! Put it out until Judgement Day
