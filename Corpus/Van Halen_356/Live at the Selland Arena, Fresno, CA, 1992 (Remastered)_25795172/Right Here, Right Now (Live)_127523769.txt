Head in the clouds you never touch the ground
You're in such a hurry you might lose what you've found
In an out of town, time for you to settle down
Stand back take a look around you
You're running from the pressures of the restless world
Hush for a moment, baby, just be still
Here now
Spend a minute next to me
Slow down
Take the time to let it be
I wanna show you there's no place better than here right now
Meet me where icebergs melt in the sun
(Ooh)
Let all the ties that bound you come undone
(Ooh)
...
