Sshha!

They may talk about you cold when you were
Headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby
Didn't that change with a wink o' your eye?
Now no one's talking 'bout those crazy days gone by
No one talks about the times you cried

(Oooh-oooh) Little dreamer
(Oooh-oooh) Little dreamer
...
