It's Ok, i'll do what i want
If i choose, i can take the fall
There's a choice
It's my destiny
In my hands
Yeah, it's up to me
I can drive
I can shoot a gun in the streets
Score me some heroin
I can jump
Be the sacrifice
Bear the cross just like Jesus Christ

And i don't wanna hear
What love can do
No, I ain't donna tell ya
What's right for you

Is it right to take the easy way
Close your eyes
Get on your knees an'pray
Now you're saved by a higher voice
...
