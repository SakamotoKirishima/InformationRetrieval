Walk me down to the wishing well
Help me find that miracle
Splash that holy water on me
Drown my faith in trinity, yeah
Oh yeah

Little by little, gonna get it, I swear
One more piece of the puzzle, I'm there
Gotta get lucky, gotta get that done
Little bit of luck never hurt no one

Come on take me down down down...
I'm in a cold sweat
...
