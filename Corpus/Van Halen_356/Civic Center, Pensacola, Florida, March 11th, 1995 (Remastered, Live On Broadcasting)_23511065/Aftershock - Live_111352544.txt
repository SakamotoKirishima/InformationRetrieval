Oh, yeah!
Alright

I don't care 'bout the way that you're treatin' me
And I ain't cryin' about the love I been payin' for
No I ain't bitchin' 'bout the things you been puttin' down
Yeah, in my street

Oh! I ain't goin' around sayin' things about you
Lord, I can't repeat

Hey, it ain't gonna change overnight, no
And it ain't goin' away without a fight, no!

Now I ain't sayin' that I'm never gonna beg you
Oh, baby come back
Right now baby, I don't really wanna see your face
Yeah, and that's a fact

Oh, I know honey all I know is what I'm feelin' inside
...
