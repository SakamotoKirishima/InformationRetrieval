Oh-oh! Mmm-hmm!
Ow!
That's right

She don't like it when it's cut n' dry
And don't like me makin' future plans
And don't want me tryin' to pin her down
She ain't about to give an inch of ground, no!
Woo!

Well, she can take me for a little ride
Just as long as she drive me home
Around the block, maybe once or twice
And then some lovin'. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah!

I won't, but I want it
Oh, what a fool believes
I got her in my sight, but just outta reach. Oh-oh!

Here we go around (Round round round)
Run, run, runaround, yeah (Round round round round)
Here we go around (Round round round)
...
