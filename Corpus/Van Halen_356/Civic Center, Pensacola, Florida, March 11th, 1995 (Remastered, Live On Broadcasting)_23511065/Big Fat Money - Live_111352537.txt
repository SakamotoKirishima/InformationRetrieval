Al, do you want a click on this one?
I don't need no stinkin' click!
Two, three, four

Some say money is bad for the soul
Bad for the rock, bad for the roll
Bad for the heart, bad for the brain
Bad for damn near everything, oh yeah!

Oh. Hey, it must be good for somethin'
Come on, pay the rent
(Yes)

Telephone, telefax, telefuckin' teletrash
Tell a cop, tell a friend, think we hit the stoney end
Nothin' left, nothin' right, now they want a bigger bite
