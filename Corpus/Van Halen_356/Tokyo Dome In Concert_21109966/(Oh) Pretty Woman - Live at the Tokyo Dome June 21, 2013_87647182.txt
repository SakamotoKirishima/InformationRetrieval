(Oh) Pretty Woman (Live) - Van Halen
Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you it must be true
No one could look as good as you

Mercy
Pretty woman wont you pardon me
Pretty woman I couldnt help but see
Pretty woman, oh you look lovely as you could be
Are you lonely just lik me
...
