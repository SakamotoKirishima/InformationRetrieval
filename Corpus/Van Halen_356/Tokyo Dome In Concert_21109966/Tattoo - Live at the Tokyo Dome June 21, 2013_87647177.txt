I got Elvis on my elbow
When I flex it, Elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
and she hula's when I walk.

screaming 'lectric green
purple mountain's majesty
talk to me! Talk to me babe!

So I don't buy your graphic

Best believe that needle will hurt you
Best to see these true colors that follow
one of your false virtues

Little Secret to make you think
Why is the crazy stuff we never say
always written in ink?
