(Woo!)
(Ahh ha ha ha ha ha!)

We came here to entertain you
Leaving here we aggravate you
Don't you know it means the same to me?

Honey!
I'm the one, the one you love
C'mon baby show your love
Hey, give it to me

I see a glow that fills this room
I see it rolling off of you
And now your message from above
I'm tellin' you, (Oww!) show
C'mon and show your love
Ah, yeah (Show your love)
(Ow, ooh, ohh!) Show, (Show) show your love babe
...
