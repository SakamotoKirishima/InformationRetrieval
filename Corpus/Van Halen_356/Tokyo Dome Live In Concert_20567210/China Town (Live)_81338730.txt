Headless body in a topless bar.
Warring clans in lowered cars.
A buck is still a buck in Shanghai
and a buck is all you earn.

A great night for all concerned.
Steel fingers play a deadly song.
Whole lotta Shakespeare going on and on and on.

It's all happening downtown.
You painted daughters of the Tong underground
don't mess around.

Welcome to China Town.
Well, you're in our town now.
Welcome to China Town.
