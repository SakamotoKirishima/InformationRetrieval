I heard the news, baby
All about your disease
Yeah, you may have all you want baby
But I got somethin' you need, oh yeah

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before! Yeah, before

You know you're semi-good lookin'
And on the streets again
Oh yeah, you think you're really cookin' baby
You better find yourself a friend, my friend

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't gonna talk about love
Just like I told you before!
