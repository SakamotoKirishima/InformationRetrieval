She saw the look in his eyes
And she knew better
He wanted her tonight
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad

Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, oh, oh, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie wouldn't say, "All right"
She knew he'd forget her
And so they said goodnight
And now he's gone forever
...
