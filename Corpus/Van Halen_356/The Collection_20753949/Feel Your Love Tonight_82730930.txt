All right

We're gettin' funny in the back of my car
I'm sorry honey, if I took it just you little too far, yes
Ah too, too far
So I, I told the fellas out behind the bar
Told them to tell you honey, just how fine you are, yes
Ah yes, you are

You see I'm beggin' you please
(Beggin' you baby, beggin' on my bended knees) On my knees

Sayin' "I can't wait to feel your love tonight", whooh!

See you drivin' up and down my road
I tell you honey, you're the prettiest girl I know, yes
Uh, that's for sure
...
