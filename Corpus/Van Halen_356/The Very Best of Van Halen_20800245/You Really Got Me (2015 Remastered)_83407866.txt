Girl, you really got me now
You've got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Girl, you really got me now
You've got me so I can't sleep at night

Girl, you've really got me now
You've got me so I don't know where I'm goin', yeah
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You've got me so I can't sleep at night

You really got me (Oh!)
You really got me (Whoa oh!)
You really got me

Please, don't ever let me be
