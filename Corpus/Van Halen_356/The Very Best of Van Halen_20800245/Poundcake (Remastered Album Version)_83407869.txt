Ahh, yeah

Yeah, she's gotta have soul
Or it won't feel right
Well, just plain, clean and simple
Wrapped up, nice and tight

In a home grown and down home
That makes a woman
Cookin' up that old time, long lost recipe, for me

It's gettin' hard to find
Guess it ain't hip enough now
You take an average guy
Who can't identify
And there's a short supply
Ooh, of the fine, fine stuff

Let me get on, let me get on, let me get on some of that
Shake it up, pick it out nice
Let me get on, let me get on, let me get on outta there
I still love my baby's poundcake
...
