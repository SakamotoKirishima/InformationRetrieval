(Eddie Piano Intro)

The loss that you feel, I know that it's real.
It's so hard when love is blind.
You put your heart on the line.
Now you feel like i'm wasting your time,
But I know that someday, somehow, you'll learn to love.
I knoooooooooooooow (oooooh)

(Chorus)
I'm learning To See
But I don't have glasses
...
