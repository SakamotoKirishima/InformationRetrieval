Sweet life livin'
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sitting
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and

That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and tryna be

I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?
...
