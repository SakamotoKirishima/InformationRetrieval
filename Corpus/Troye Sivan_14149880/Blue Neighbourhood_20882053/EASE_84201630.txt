I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone

But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me

And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

...
