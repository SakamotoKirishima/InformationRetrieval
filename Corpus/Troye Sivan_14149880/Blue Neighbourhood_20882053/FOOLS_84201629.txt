I am tired of this place
I hope people change
I need time to replace
What I gave away
And my hopes
They are high
I must keep them small
Though I try to resist
I still want it all

I see swimming pools
And living rooms
And aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill
And children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice
And Tanqueray
But everything is shattering
And it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you
Only fools
Only fools do what I do
Only fools fall
Only fools fall for you
Only fools
Only fools do what I do
...
