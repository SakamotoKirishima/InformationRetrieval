We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make up

We make a really good team
Though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry between us

Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichs on our own little tour
Let's ride

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
...
