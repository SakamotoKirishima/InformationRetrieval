In my free, in my wild
In my dark, what we've started
Started to doubt, doubt this fire
Lighting up our lives
When you call me up at night
Crashing byes all I know
I think that's why I made you go
Those three words, you were my first
I can't help thinking

Maybe you were my Blue Moon
Maybe I let go too soon
Running from what it could be
So terrified of happy
Hiding all I come to lose
My Blue Moon
My Blue Moon
...
