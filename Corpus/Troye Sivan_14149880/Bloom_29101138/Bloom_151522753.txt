Take a trip into my garden
I've got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

And it's true, babe
I've been saving this for you, baby

I guess it's something like a fun fair
Put gas into the motor
And boy, I'll meet you right there
We'll ride the roller coaster

'Cause it's true, babe
I've been saving this for you, baby

I need you to, tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll, hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to, take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

Yeah I bloom, I bloom just for you
I bloom, just for you
Yeah I bloom, I bloom just for you
I bloom, just for you
...
