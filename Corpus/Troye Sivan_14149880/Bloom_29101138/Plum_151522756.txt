Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling

Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh no

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

...
