Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights, oh-oh
Take in it all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna spend with you
I wanna be with you
...
