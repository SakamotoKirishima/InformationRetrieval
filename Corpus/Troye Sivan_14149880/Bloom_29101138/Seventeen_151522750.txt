I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number
Just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love
When I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young
But it was real to me
And in the heat of the night
Saw things I'd never seen
...
