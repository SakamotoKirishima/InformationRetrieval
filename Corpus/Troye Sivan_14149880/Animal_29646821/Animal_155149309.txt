I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I can't keep my hands off you
While you're lying awake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

An ode to the boy I love
...
