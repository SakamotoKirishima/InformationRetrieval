I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced
And swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees

I got the good side of you
Sent it out into the blue
The people danced
To the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathise
And I recognise
And baby, I apologise
That I got the good side
The good side of things
...
