I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side
So when your tears roll down your pillow
Roll down your pillow
Roll down your

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
...
