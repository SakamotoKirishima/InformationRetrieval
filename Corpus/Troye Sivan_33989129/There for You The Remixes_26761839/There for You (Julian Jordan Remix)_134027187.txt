I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side
So when your tears roll down
Your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming
But they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too
Last year took a toll on me
...
