I always shoot first
Never ask questions.
Never think of consequences.
I didn't feel a thing.
I didn't feel a thing.
I never think twice.
No intentions.
Never feel the consequences.
Untill it starts to sting.
Untill it starts to sting.
No!
It never hurt like this before.
No!
Nothing's Fair in Love and War.
Turn out
The lights.
Nothing's Fair in Love and War.
It's too late
To lie.
Nothing's Fair in Love and War.
...
