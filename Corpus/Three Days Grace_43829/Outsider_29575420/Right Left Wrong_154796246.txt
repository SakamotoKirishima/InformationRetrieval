Sometimes I just wanna run away
Run away
Run away
I only wanna disappear
Far from here
Away from everyone
Before I come undone
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left right left
Right left wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Moving on
Moving on

I've been thinking about it
...
