We had fire in our eyes
(In the beginning I)
Never felt so alive
(In the beginning you)
You blame me but
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't want to hear it anymore

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore
