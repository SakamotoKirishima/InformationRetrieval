I walk alone
Think of home
Memories of long ago
No one knows I lost
My soul long ago

Lie too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home
...
