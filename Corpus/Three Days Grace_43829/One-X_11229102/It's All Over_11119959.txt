Your bottle's almost empty
You know this can't go on
Because of you my mind is always racing
The needle's breaking your skin
The scar is sinking in
And now your trip begins but
It's all over for
It's all over for

You
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over

...
