Under the surface
Wires are crossed
At any moment I can go off
And I can't hold much longer
Keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time

I'm living like a landmine waiting to explode
I'm ticking like a time-bomb ready to go
I'm a danger to myself and everybody else I'm
Living like a landmine waiting to explode
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go

...
