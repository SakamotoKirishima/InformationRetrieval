So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it

You could say that I'm going insane
And I'm not quite right
And I'm that to blame

You could say that I'm sick on the inside

Bet you don't know why I like it that way
You could say whatever you like

If it's so wrong I don't wanna be right
So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
