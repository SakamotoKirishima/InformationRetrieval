How'd I wind up here again?
It's like I'm always getting
Blood on my hands.
All it takes is one
And I'm gone
And a thousand till the end.
How'd I wind up here again?

You take me to the edge.
You push me too far.
You watch me slip away.

Holding on too hard.

Tell me why
Does everything that I love
Get taken away
From me?
Why does everything that I love
Get taken away?
You take me to the edge.
You push me too far.
You watch me slip away.
Holding on too hard.
Tell me why
Does everything that I love

Get taken away
From me?
