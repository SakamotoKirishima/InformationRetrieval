I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

Started with a kick and a punch
A claw to the face
And I was in the race
I was in the race
Yeah!
Yeah!

You know it's hard sometimes
Being humankind
Keeping up with the pace
Keeping up with the pace
Yeah!
Yeah!

I'm sick of running
...
