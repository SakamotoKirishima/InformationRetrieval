Raise a glass to the end of it all
Who's to blame when it's everyone's fault?
And we celebrate our way through dangerous times
Strange days are comin' for us
Say goodbye to the way that it was
And we celebrate our way through dangerous times

I'm livin' in the strange days
I'm livin' in a world that I don't know
Get ready for the dark age
I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we go
Strange days here we go
...
