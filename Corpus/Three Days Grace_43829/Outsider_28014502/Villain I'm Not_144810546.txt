Go on, take it out, take it out on me
Cause you know I'm the only one who knows what you need
You want me to be guilty
To be the one who's wrong
So easy to blame me
It's been that way for so long

Go on, go on and hurt the one that you love
Go on and make me the one that you want to hate
If it makes you feel better
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got
Go on and make me the villain I'm not
If it makes you feel better

I know no one's ever been there for you
...
