Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

Another night I'm barely holding on
One step away from being dead and gone
In my life to die another day
Is this life that I've been living?
All that's meant for me?

Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
...
