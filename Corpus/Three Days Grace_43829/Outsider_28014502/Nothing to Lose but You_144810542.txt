I stay up every night
I should've thought twice when I put our lives on the line
I'm a mess
You're the only hope that I hold inside
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
You're the reason I'm still alive

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
I wanna leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you
...
