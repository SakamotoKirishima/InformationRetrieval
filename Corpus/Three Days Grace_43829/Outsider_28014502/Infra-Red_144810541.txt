From the darkness I see the light in you

Don't stress, don't stress
No one knows what goes on in our heads, our heads
We are invisible to the rest, the rest
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have, we have

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-Red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you

In Infra-Red
The heat and the light in the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you
...
