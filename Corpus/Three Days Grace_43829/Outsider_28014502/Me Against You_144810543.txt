You need to get this straight
I will never cooperate with you
You try to control me
And the pain I feel seems to make you happy

Fuck that
I'm down so low I've got nothing to lose
Won't put thoughts in my head trying to tell me what to do
Fuck that
And every step you think I'm under your shoe
If you're breaking my back, I'll be breaking yours too

If you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you
...
